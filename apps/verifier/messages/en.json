  "verifier_guide_desc": "Your reviews shape how learners hear and correct themselves. Read the guidance below before you begin.",

  "verifier_approach_desc": "You don't need a teaching background — just a fair ear and a clear method.",
  "verifier_listen_title": "Listen First, Score Second",
  "verifier_listen_desc": "Play the learner's recording fully at least once before touching any score. Snap judgements drift over time.",
  "verifier_consistent_title": "Be Consistent, Not Lenient",
  "verifier_consistent_desc": "A 3 means \"understood with effort.\" A 5 means a native speaker wouldn't blink. Anchor each session to these markers and you'll stay calibrated across hundreds of reviews.",

  "verifier_exemplar_title": "The Exemplar Recording",
  "verifier_exemplar_desc": "After scoring, record yourself saying the phrase correctly. This exemplar is sent back to the learner alongside your scores so they can hear what they're aiming for.",

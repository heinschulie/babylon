  "theory_title": "How isiXhosa Works",
  "theory_intro": "isiXhosa is a Nguni Bantu language spoken by roughly 8 million people in South Africa. Understanding a few core patterns will transform how you hear and speak it.",
  "theory_section_clicks_title": "Click Consonants",
  "theory_section_clicks_body": "isiXhosa has three distinct click sounds, each written with a single letter. The dental click 'c' is made by pulling the tongue sharply down from behind the top front teeth — the same sound English speakers write as 'tsk-tsk'. The alveolar click 'q' is produced by pulling the tongue down from the roof of the mouth, creating a loud, sharp pop — like the sound of a cork popping. The lateral click 'x' is made by placing the tongue against the side teeth and pulling it inward, producing the 'tch-tch' sound sometimes used to urge a horse forward.\n\nEach click can be modified with aspiration (adding an 'h'), nasalisation (adding 'n' or 'ng'), or voicing (adding 'g'). So 'c' gives rise to 'ch', 'gc', 'nc', 'nkc' and similar combinations. The same applies to 'q' and 'x'. This means there are roughly 15 click consonant combinations in everyday use.\n\nThe best way to learn clicks is by ear. Listen to native speakers, imitate the tongue placement, and practise in short bursts. Written descriptions can only take you so far — your muscle memory will do the real work.",
  "theory_section_agglutination_title": "Words Build Like Lego",
  "theory_section_agglutination_body": "isiXhosa is an agglutinative language, meaning words are built by stacking meaningful pieces (morphemes) together. A single verb in isiXhosa can express what English needs a whole sentence for.\n\nTake the word 'uyamthanda' — it breaks down as: u- (he/she, subject concord) + -ya- (present tense long form marker) + -m- (him/her, object concord) + -thanda (love, verb root). So 'uyamthanda' means 'he/she loves him/her'.\n\nOnce you learn to recognise these building blocks, long words stop being intimidating. You start seeing patterns: prefixes that mark the subject, infixes that mark the object, suffixes that change tense or mood. It is a system of remarkable regularity.",
  "theory_section_noun_classes_title": "15+ Noun Classes",
  "theory_section_noun_classes_body": "Where English has 'the' and 'a', isiXhosa has noun classes — groups of nouns that share a prefix and trigger matching prefixes on adjectives, verbs, and pronouns. There are over 15 classes, often taught in paired singular/plural groups.\n\nFor example, Class 1/2 covers people: 'umfazi' (woman) / 'abafazi' (women). Class 7/8 covers many objects: 'isitulo' (chair) / 'izitulo' (chairs). Class 9/10 covers animals and borrowed words: 'inja' (dog) / 'izinja' (dogs).\n\nThe key insight is concordial agreement: every part of the sentence must 'agree' with the noun class of the subject. If the subject is in Class 1 (um-), the verb gets a 'u-' prefix, the adjective gets an 'om-' prefix, and so on. Once you internalise the class prefixes, grammar clicks into place because the whole sentence echoes the same pattern.",
  "theory_section_vowels_title": "Five Pure Vowels",
  "theory_section_vowels_body": "isiXhosa has five vowels: a, e, i, o, u. Unlike English, each vowel has one consistent sound — no silent letters, no surprises.\n\n'a' sounds like the 'a' in 'father'. 'e' sounds like the 'e' in 'bed'. 'i' sounds like the 'ee' in 'see'. 'o' sounds like the 'o' in 'more'. 'u' sounds like the 'oo' in 'food'.\n\nThis regularity makes pronunciation predictable once you learn the five sounds. Every vowel you see is pronounced, and each one sounds the same regardless of its position in the word.",
  "theory_section_tone_title": "Tone Matters",
  "theory_section_tone_body": "isiXhosa is a tonal language. The pitch of a syllable — whether your voice goes high or low — can change the meaning of a word entirely. This is different from English, where pitch mainly conveys emotion or emphasis.\n\nFor example, the word 'ukúbala' (to count) and 'ukùbala' (to write) differ only in tone. The syllables and consonants are identical; only the pitch pattern changes.\n\nAs a beginner, do not stress about mastering tone from day one. Focus on imitating native speakers as closely as possible. Over time, your ear will start picking up the pitch patterns naturally. Listening is more effective than studying tone rules in a textbook.",
  "theory_section_patterns_title": "Grammar Is Patterns, Not Rules",
  "theory_section_patterns_body": "isiXhosa grammar is built on repeating patterns rather than long lists of exceptions. The subject concord — a prefix on the verb that agrees with the noun class of the subject — is the foundation of nearly every sentence.\n\nBasic sentence structure follows Subject-Verb-Object order: 'Umfana udlala ibhola' (The boy plays ball). The verb 'udlala' carries the prefix 'u-' because 'umfana' (boy) is Class 1.\n\nNegation follows a pattern too: the prefix changes and a suffix '-i' is added. 'Ndiyahamba' (I am going) becomes 'Andihambhi' (I am not going). Past tense adds '-ile' or '-e' to the verb stem: 'ndihambile' (I went).\n\nThe more you practise, the more these patterns become second nature. isiXhosa rewards consistency — the same prefixes, suffixes, and concords appear again and again across different contexts. Trust the patterns and they will carry you.",
